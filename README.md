## Welcome to our design project
Our project is mainly focusing automation of household cleaning purposes.It is very helpful to the housekeeper's withthe help of bluetooth technology.It is also user friendly and low budget product.

### Introduction

In early, 2010 a new automatic floor cleaner robot “Mint” was developed by Jen 
Steffen. Detachable clothes were attached for sweeping and mopping purposes. For 
tracking mint used the GPS-like indoor localization system.
A floor cleaner robot based on Arduino UNO have been developed. Atachable mop 
is used for mopping. Unlike other floor cleaner robots this is not a vacuum cleaner robot,it 
performs sweeping and mopping operation. It works on 12V supply.The cleaning action is 
controlled by bluetooth module.
In the manual mode, user itself operates the robot.
Bluetooth module have been used to transmit and receive the signal for controlling the 
robot through the phone by the user itself.Therefore user can move the robot in the desired direction
